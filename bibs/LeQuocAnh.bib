abstract = {Contactless measurement of cardio-vascular pulse acts an essential role in clinical medical sectors. Estimating cardio-vascular pulses based on continuous-wave (CW) Doppler radar in limited time while maintaining the accuracy is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a signal processing method that combines empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) for a short time estimation of heart rate (HR) and inter-beat-interval from radar signals. We evaluate performance of the proposed method using 85 patients with dengue fever and 40 healthy subjects. Subsequently, the estimated contactless HR is compared to that of a commercial contact-type medical device. The result shows that the HR can be estimated within a period of 5 s with an accuracy of 96.2 ± 2.5%. The patients with dengue fever show an elevated HR and a decreased standard deviation of heartbeat interval (SDHI). Finally, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is utilized with two parameters HR and SDHI to classify the dengue patients, achieving the sensitivity and specificity values of 86.3% and 86.9%, respectively.}

abstract = {Purpose: Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) has been proven to be an effective treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. In clinical practice, the treatment planning for SIRT using 90Y microspheres requires estimation of the liver-lung shunt fraction (LSF) to avoid radiation pneumonitis. Currently, the manual segmentation method to draw a region of interest (ROI) of the liver and lung in 2D planar imaging of 99mTc-MAA and 3D SPECT/CT images is inconvenient, time-consuming and observer-dependent. In this study, we propose and evaluate a nearly automatic method for LSF quantification using 3D SPECT/CT images, offering improved performance compared with the current manual segmentation method. Methods: We retrospectively acquired 3D SPECT with non-contrast-enhanced CT images (nCECT) of 60 HCC patients from a SPECT/CT scanning machine, along with the corresponding diagnostic contrast-enhanced CT images (CECT). Our approach for LSF quantification is to use CNN-based methods for liver and lung segmentations in the nCECT image. We first apply 3D ResUnet to coarsely segment the liver. If the liver segmentation contains a large error, we dilate the coarse liver segmentation into the liver mask as a ROI in the nCECT image. Subsequently, non-rigid registration is applied to deform the liver in the CECT image to fit that obtained in the nCECT image. The final liver segmentation is obtained by segmenting the liver in the deformed CECT image using nnU-Net. In addition, the lung segmentations are obtained using 2D ResUnet. Finally, LSF quantitation is performed based on the number of counts in the SPECT image inside the segmentations. Evaluations and Results: To evaluate the liver segmentation accuracy, we used Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), asymmetric surface distance (ASSD), and max surface distance (MSD) and compared the proposed method to five well-known CNN-based methods for liver segmentation. Furthermore, the LSF error obtained by the proposed method was compared to a state-of-the-art method, modified Deepmedic, and the LSF quantifications obtained by manual segmentation. The results show that the proposed method achieved a DSC score for the liver segmentation that is comparable to other state-of-the-art methods, with an average of 0.93, and the highest consistency in segmentation accuracy, yielding a standard deviation of the DSC score of 0.01. The proposed method also obtains the lowest ASSD and MSD scores on average (2.6 mm and 31.5 mm, respectively). Moreover, for the proposed method, a median LSF error of 0.14% is obtained, which is a statically significant improvement to the state-of-the-art-method (p=0.004), and is much smaller than the median error in LSF manual determination by the medical experts using 2D planar image (1.74% and p<0.001). Conclusions: A method for LSF quantification using 3D SPECT/CT images based on CNNs and non-rigid registration was proposed, evaluated and compared to state-of-the-art techniques. The proposed method can quantitatively determine the LSF with high accuracy and has the potential to be applied in clinical practice.}
